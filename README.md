# leaflet-annotated-map-helper

It lives here: https://leaflethelper.vercel.app/

Helps to create a map with drawings/annotations on it to put on a webpage. There is a map that you can draw on, then the page will automatically generate some javascript to copy into your website. 
Hopefully, this saves time writing the javascript manually and guessing at co-ordinates etc.
